			Heavy Metal Music: History and Misconceptions Heavy metal music has been a source of social controversy since its early beginnings. 
			It started out as a new age form of rock. Heavy metal brought a new look and sound to rock. The early heavy metal musicians decided to tune their guitars down, 
			increase the tempo, play guitars and drums faster, and get a more grungy sound. The musicians also decided to wear tight, ripped, black clothing, chains, spikes,
			and combat boots. Most people did as anyone would expect them to do when faced with something fairly new, they found it strange and looked down on it. 
			Much of society did not actually delve into heavy metal to find out what it is truly all about, and made assumptions that were untrue.
