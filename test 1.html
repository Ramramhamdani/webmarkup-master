		Slash bio
		</h1>
		<p> <a name = "slash"></a>
		Saul Hudson (born July 23, 1965), better known by his stage name Slash, is an English-American musician and songwriter.
		 He is best known as the lead guitarist of the American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
		During his later years with Guns N' Roses, Slash formed the side project Slash's Snakepit. 
		After leaving Guns N' Roses in 1996, he co-founded the supergroup Velvet Revolver, which re-established him as a mainstream performer in the mid to late 2000s. 
		Slash has released three solo albums: Slash (2010), featuring an array of guest musicians, and Apocalyptic Love (2012) and World on Fire (2014), recorded with his band, 
		Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators. He returned to Guns N' Roses in 2016.
