		the best games ever

		<a name="1st paragraph">

		six years ago, The New York Times asked me to become a video game critic. Like most sufferers of the Dunning-Kruger effect, I figured I would quickly show everyone how the job should really be done. 
		Three years later, my editors not only canceled my column, but they also jettisoned the idea of game criticism entirely,
		ending a run of 17 years in which the paper of record published video game reviews on a consistent basis. Oops.Writing is hard. Making video games is hard. 
		Writing about video games? That’s like surviving Oregon Trail on bare bones rations and a grueling pace. (Am I dating myself? Oregon Trail was a kind of historically inflected 
		Dark Souls that they let us play in grade school, back when we didn’t know what Minecraft was.) To write about video games, you need to know something about art history, computer 
		science, sports, psychology, economics, the Happenings of the 1960s, experimental theater, improv, animation, film theory and Dungeons and Dragons, and then also familiarize yourself 
		with scores of games that are playable only on technology stored — for distributed safekeeping — in cardboard boxes in the basements and attics of our national grandparent reserve.
